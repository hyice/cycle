`cycle` is a simpy `Pomodoro Technique` status bar app. It can help you have a concentrated period.

Without too much feature, `cycle` only focus on the core function:

- has / done
  - start/stop a concentrated period
  - progress on status bar icon
  - has and only has a status bar icon
- will have / todo
  - customize last time of the concentrated period
  - switch to use accurate left time instead of progress
- never
  - ads
  - pro version
